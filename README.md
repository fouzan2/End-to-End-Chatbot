# End-to-End-Chatbot
An end-to-end chatbot refers to a chatbot that can handle a complete conversation from start to finish without requiring human assistance. To create an end-to-end chatbot, you need to write a computer program that can understand user requests, generate appropriate responses, and take action when necessary.  This involves collecting data, choosing a programming language and NLP tools, training the chatbot, and testing and refining it before making it available to users.

Once deployed, users can interact with the chatbot by sending it multiple requests and the chatbot can handle the entire conversation itself. To create an end-to-end chatbot using Python, we can follow the steps mentioned below:

1) Define Intents
2) Create training data
3) Train the chatbot
4) Build the chatbot
5) Test the chatbot
6) Deploy the chatbot

# RUN THE PYTHON SCRIPT
To run the python file and to see the chatbot as web application use this command on Jupyter notebook or command prompt:
1) For Jupyter Notebook: !streamlit run streamlit_app.py
2) For Command Prompt: streamlit run streamlit_app.py
